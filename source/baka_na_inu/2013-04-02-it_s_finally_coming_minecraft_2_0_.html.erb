<p></p><p><a href="http://d1y0oqfyli6x95.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/minecraft2_warm.jpg"><img alt="" height="263" src="http://d1y0oqfyli6x95.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/minecraft2_warm.jpg" title="Minecraft 2.0 Concept Art" width="500"></a><br> Minecraft PC edition is about to hit 10,000,000 sales. I don’t know about you guys, but we’re really excited about this major milestone in Minecraft history. We decided that this would be the perfect time to announce our next upcoming title, “Minecraft 2″.</p> <p>Hopefully releasing within the next two months, this 2-years-in-development game will be bringing blocky simulation games to the next level. Whilst based off the original Minecraft engine, this new version completely overhauls major parts of the game and contains many weeks worth of new content and blocks. Currently in closed beta stage, we have secretly been working with a select few members of the community to participate and trial run some specific features from the new version. Neither Mojang nor Minecraft would be where it is today without its community, so we felt it fitting that we let them make the trailer videos and announcements for us, which are visible below.</p> <h2>Sneak-peek videos</h2> <p><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/v-jjpPMcFkM" width="500"></iframe><br><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wka0IwBn_IU" width="500"></iframe><br><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Jo_dHXShb0Y" width="500"></iframe></p> <ul><li>SethBling – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diN0Dn-H1OI">MindCrack SMP — Ep 1: MineCraft 2.0 Pre-Release Review</a></li> <li>BlameTheController – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUkmNZL14qM">Minecraft 2.0 Beta Ep 1: Multiplayer Dungeon World first</a></li> <li>Guude – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXjtgOrFnTY">Minecraft MindCrack – S4E1 – Minecraft 2.0</a></li> <li>Xisumavoid – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqfXFEwotnY">Minecraft 2.0 Update Preview</a></li> <li>Keralis – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tVdRm8_OME">Wife vs. Minecraft – Episode 30: Minecraft 2.0!</a></li> <li>Biffa2001 – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo_dHXShb0Y">Minecraft 2.0 One Life – “Death By Blue Chickens”</a></li> <li><ins>Docm77 – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERQDPF5-4zQ">Minecraft 2.0 Closed Beta – Exclusive First Look</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>W92Baj – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye1Wt7RcDmE">Minecraft 2.0 – You wont believe what has been added – Mindcrack prelease overview.</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Mhykol – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32yVStMdulM">Mhykol Mines – Mindcrack – Episode 259 – Minecraft 2.0</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Generikb – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpGl2g4YqZs">Minecraft 2.0 FIRST LOOK!</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Vechs – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-jjpPMcFkM">Ep01 Minecraft 2.0 LP – A Fresh Start</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Paul Soares Jr – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wka0IwBn_IU">Minecraft 2.0 – Mindcrack EXCLUSIVE SNEAK PEEK!</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Pyropuncher – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nalh8D5U2A4">Minecraft 2.0 Footage!</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Pakratt0013 – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNB84rvVd9M">Pakratt’s Collections 55: First Impressions of 2.0</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>AvidyaZen – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWmk3RhwYGM">MINECRAFT 2.0 – THE NDA HAS BEEN LIFTED!</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Joe Hills – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWKmVkXWzHE">Minecraft 2.0, now with more abominations!</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>Millbee – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blMjPnJNUJU">Preview Of The Minecraft 2.0 Update!</a></ins></li><ins> </ins><li><ins>AnderZel – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z41s0RbO_zk">Minecraft 2.0 Update Pink Witter?</a></ins></li> </ul><p>More coming soon!
