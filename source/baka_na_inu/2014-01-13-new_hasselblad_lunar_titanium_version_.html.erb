They will make a limited edition of 200 pieces and each will cost 7200 Euro without taxes. Why the red and yellow colors? Because they represent the chinese colors for fortune.

Only two hundred have been developed in our Italy-based design centre and the exclusive red and gold colours on the grip and body underpin the traditional Chinese belief that these shades represent good fortune and joy.</p> <p>“Our Lunar mirrorless, interchangeable lens camera range embraces all the advanced technology found in top DSLR models and each unit in this latest Limited Edition version is offered sequentially numbered.”</p> <p>He added: “This is a unique opportunity for a very small number of discerning photographers who want high-spec shooting capability linked with matchless Italian craftsmanship in a point and shoot camera, to invest in a photo-capture icon.”</p> <p>The feature-rich 24 megapixel Hasselblad Lunar Limited Edition camera incorporates Full HD Video capability and bundles with a black E-mount 18-55mm lens. The camera’s wide range ISO sensitivity allows the user to shoot in almost any light. The unit’s special PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) finish provides hardness that is second only to diamond.</p> <p>Hasselblad’s Lunar range, first launched last year, was inspired by the company’s first camera in space – the now legendary Hasselblad 500C.</p> <p>For more information please visit <a href="http://redirectingat.com?id=19445X767312&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hasselblad-lunar.com%2Flimited-edition&amp;sref=rss" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.hasselblad-lunar.com/limited-edition</a></p> <p>—</p> <p></p> <p>Found via <a href="http://redirectingat.com?id=19445X767312&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quesabesde.com%2Fnoticias%2Fhasselblad-lunar-edicion-limitada_11298&amp;sref=rss" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Quesabesde</a>.</p> <p></p>
