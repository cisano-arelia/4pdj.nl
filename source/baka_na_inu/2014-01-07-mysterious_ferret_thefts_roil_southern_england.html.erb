Throughout rural southern England over the past two years, there's been a rise in the number of ferret thefts, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304361604579290013495981126">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <p>The story begins with Ken Jenkins, a pest controller who uses ferrets to remove rabbits from open fields near the ancient site of Stonehenge, a site <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbyzgeee2mg">shrouded in mystery</a>. But the more pressing enigma on Jenkin's mind: Why are people stealing ferrets? </p> <p>Some ferret enthusiasts say thieves sell animals for clandestine drug research, Mr. Jenkins says. Others speculate they go to the illicit pet trade. Many suspect the involvement of organized-crime rings.</p> <p>"These people are linked to badger baiting, dog fighting and worse," says Mr. Jenkins's business partner, James Bradley, referring to a banned practice of using dogs to maim badgers for sport.</p> <p>Mr. Bradley says he had about 27 ferrets filched last February in an unsolved crime that added his name to the long list of victims. "I know of a lot of disillusioned people who have had their ferrets stolen," he says.</p> <p>As if there were anything worse than lost ferret disillusionment (LFD, soon to be a recognized psychiatric condition), the thefts seem to make little sense: Ferrets are not especially valuable, and they also breed rapidly and often have leftover, unwanted young. The Journal continues: </p> <p>Now is a worrying time for the "working ferrets" of the U.K. The domesticated descendants of European polecats have for centuries been used to hunt <a href="http://www.popsci.com/category/tags/rabbits">rabbits</a>. "Since the Romans," says Mr. Jenkins, who breeds a strain of ferrets inherited from his father...</p> <p>Across rural England, thieves—often with balaclavas, Mr. Bradley says—have struck at night, carrying off their writhing contraband in pillowcases.</p> <p>"They leave everything of value and just take the ferrets," says Mr. Bradley, puzzled.</p> <p>Ferrets aren't the only English animals that are being stolen more often in recent years. According to the Telegraph, dog kidnappings <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/pets/9797749/Dognappings-organised-gangs-behind-a-surge-of-dog-thefts-across-the-country.html">are also on the rise</a>: 3,500 dogs were stolen in England in 2012, a 17 percent increase over the year prior. </p> <p>As if things couldn't get worse for ferrets, researchers recently engineered a highly-contagious <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-06/how-give-ferrets-highly-contagious-sneeze-transmissible-version-bird-flu">form of the bird flu that can infect ferrets</a> and pass between them when the animals sneeze. Ah-Choose your poison, ferrets! </p> </div></div></div><img border="0" height="1" src="http://popsci.feedsportal.com/c/34567/f/632419/s/359d2dcd/sc/7/mf.gif" width="1" /><br clear="all" /><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Farticle%2Fscience%2Fmysterious-ferret-thefts-roil-southern-england&amp;t=Mysterious+Ferret+Thefts+Roil+Southern+England" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Farticle%2Fscience%2Fmysterious-ferret-thefts-roil-southern-england&amp;t=Mysterious+Ferret+Thefts+Roil+Southern+England" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Farticle%2Fscience%2Fmysterious-ferret-thefts-roil-southern-england&amp;t=Mysterious+Ferret+Thefts+Roil+Southern+England" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Farticle%2Fscience%2Fmysterious-ferret-thefts-roil-southern-england&amp;t=Mysterious+Ferret+Thefts+Roil+Southern+England" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Farticle%2Fscience%2Fmysterious-ferret-thefts-roil-southern-england&amp;t=Mysterious+Ferret+Thefts+Roil+Southern+England" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" /></a></td><td valign="middle"></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" /></a><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186528335497/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/359d2dcd/a2t.img" width="1" />
