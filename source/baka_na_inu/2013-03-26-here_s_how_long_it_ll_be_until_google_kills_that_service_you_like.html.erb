<div><img alt="" src="http://www.popsci.com/files/imagecache/article_image_large/articles/Picture 12_4.png" title="" /><div><strong>Google TV</strong> <em></em></div></div><div>A mathematical look at the approximate expiration date for Google stuff. <p>With Google's recent announcement that it would be discontinuing the <a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/5-services-wed-rather-see-google-kill-google-reader">cultishly beloved Google Reader</a>, some people are understandably wary about other Google products. How long until it's decided they're "underperforming" and need to be cut? Does this stuff have an expiration date? </p> <p>Well, kinda. It's at least possible to crunch the numbers and approximate the shelf-life of a service. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/22/google-keep-services-closed"><i>The Guardian</i></a> took a look at the lifespans of 39 services that didn't survive, then plotted them to determine a mean. The magic number? 1,459 days. So Google Keep, a service released just last week, would be terminated on March 18, 2017. </p> <p>This isn't an exact time of death for any products, of course: it still has a standard deviation, in this case 689 days, although all of the services studied except iGoogle fall within two standard deviations of the mean. But that does still mean there's a 68 percent chance Google Keep will be put out to pasture between April 2015 and February 2019.</p> <p>Of course, all of this works under the assumption that Google's actually going to stop supporting a product. After all, there's still a lot of stuff it created and stuck with. (Ever heard of something called Gmail?) But you never can tell, so it might be nice to at least have a guess about how many days of use you're getting out of something.</p> <p>Check out more over <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/22/google-keep-services-closed">at <i>The Guardian</i></a>.</p> <p>[<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/22/google-keep-services-closed">The Guardian</a>]</p> </div><img border="0" height="1" src="http://popsci.feedsportal.com/c/34567/f/632419/s/2a020ad8/mf.gif" width="1" /><div><table border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/viral/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&amp;title=Here%27s+How+Long+It%27ll+Be+Until+Google+Kills+That+Service+You+Like&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Ftechnology%2Farticle%2F2013-03%2Fheres-how-long-itll-be-until-google-kills-service-you" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif" /></a></td><td valign="middle"><a href="http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Here%27s+How+Long+It%27ll+Be+Until+Google+Kills+That+Service+You+Like&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Ftechnology%2Farticle%2F2013-03%2Fheres-how-long-itll-be-until-google-kills-service-you" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/161770492437/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/2a020ad8/a2.htm"><img border="0" src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/161770492437/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/2a020ad8/a2.img" /></a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/161770492437/u/0/f/632419/c/34567/s/2a020ad8/a2t.img" width="1" />
