title: Visualizing Salesforce Data… in Minecraft!?

<p>If you have children between the ages of 9 and 19, it&#8217;s increasingly likely that you&#8217;re familiar with <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>; if not, you can think of it as a kind of virtual Lego, an open-ended, blocky, sandbox where you can build, battle, and even farm. Minecraft is a gaming phenomenon, and part of its appeal is the opportunity to modify (&#8216;mod&#8217;) the game, adding new materials, monsters, and even <a href="https://plus.google.com/+QuantumAILab/posts/grMbaaDGChH">quantum physics</a> to the &#8216;vanilla&#8217; game.</p>
<p>Taking a break after Dreamforce 2013, it occurred to me that I could create a Minecraft mod to visualize business data in 3D, modeled on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>&#8216;s cyberspace. Each Salesforce Account would be represented by a building, with rooms within each building representing Opportunities. Contacts would roam the space, interacting with you in response to events in the Salesforce environment. Close an Opportunity, and a Contact would find you and give you precious metals and gems.</p>
<p>A few days&#8217; coding later, <a href="https://github.com/metadaddy-sfdc/Forcecraft">Forcecraft</a> was born!</p>
<p><img alt="" height="471" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_740/v1389055456/Forcecraft_w5c7rl.png" width="740" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshots and video, this initial version implements the basic vision &#8211; you can explore Accounts, wandering between the rooms that represent Opportunities, seeing Opportunity status at a glance via signs and levers.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="471" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_740/v1389056038/OpportunityLevers_luzgw9.png" width="740" /></p>
<p>On startup, Forcecraft uses the <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/REST_API">Force.com REST API</a> to retrieve Accounts, Opportunities and Contacts, generating buildings and creating Contact entities as the player explores the Forcecraft dimension. The connection is read-write &#8211; throw the lever for a different Stage and you&#8217;ll see that the Opportunity was updated in Salesforce (do NOT run this on a production org!). The mod also uses the <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Streaming_API">Force.com Streaming API</a> to receive notifications on data changes within the Salesforce environment; not only does changing an Opportunity&#8217;s Stage in Salesforce result in the lever position being updated &#8216;in game&#8217;, if the Opportunity&#8217;s Stage changes to &#8216;Closed Won&#8217;, a Contact from the relevant Account will appear before you and drop items (gold, diamonds etc) representing the Opportunity Amount.</p>
<p>Take a look at Forcecraft in action:</p>

<p>But, why even build this? Firstly, it&#8217;s a proof-of-concept for visualizing your Salesforce data. You can immediately see which Account has the most Opportunities, and dig deeper into the data in a very interactive way. It&#8217;s also a great demonstration of the richness of the Force.com APIs &#8211; you really can access every byte of your Salesforce data, and metadata, via the APIs and manipulate it in any app you choose. Finally, well, it was a lot of fun; I&#8217;ve spent some quality time with my boys combining their knowledge of the Minecraft world with my Force.com API skills to create possibly the most unlikely mashup you&#8217;ll see this year!</p>
<p>I have some ideas for extending Forcecraft, such as adding integration with Chatter so I can view and post to the Chatter feed for an Account, but I&#8217;m really interested in your ideas &#8211; leave a comment below. And, if you&#8217;re a Java developer looking for a fun side project, I&#8217;m very open to pull requests. <a href="https://github.com/metadaddy-sfdc/Forcecraft">Fork the Forcecraft project on GitHub</a> and get hacking!</p>
