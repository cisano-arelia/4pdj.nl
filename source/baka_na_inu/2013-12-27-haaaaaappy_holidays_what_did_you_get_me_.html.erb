Happy holidays!  I hope everyone is having a wonderful time with friends and family or calling around town to find the one bar that's already open.  I'll be around for the next week writing a little when I can and fielding questions from my aunts about why I haven't settled down and gotten married already.  I told them it's because I haven't found the right dino.  They didn't get it, but I'm hoping it was enough to not try setting me up with 'really nice girls' from their church.  I just ate all nine cinnamon rolls, now I feel sick.  HAPPY HOLIDAYS, TELL YOUR FAMILY I SAID HI.
