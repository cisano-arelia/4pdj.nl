Vanessa turned lvl 35 today, so time to do the first trial for her 2nd class transfer.

The quest was boring like normal, moving us from orc barracks, orc village, gludin, forgotten temple, talking island, elven ruins, elven village, dark elven village and the swamp lands. Playing together is soo much fun.

Afterwards we had some nice hamburgers, watched a movie.

PS. Oh yes, Vanessa earned title Mascotte :*
