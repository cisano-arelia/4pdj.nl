Hehe, just back in WoW since 25th of Oct, got in contact with old friends and applied to their raiding guild and got accepted.

Lots of new content i didn't go through before i took my break. This week did the new VOA 10/25 bosses, Onyxia 10, Trial of the Crusader 10/25 (25 not completed) and Ulduar 10 (not completed). Â Slowly gearing up again. Got the money together to get dualspec (1k gold wtf). It helps me a lot with dailies! They should have invented that before (/copy from Lineage2).

I'll post a picture soon!
