Still waiting for my new copy of Lineage 2 to arrive. My hands are trembling and want to play. Vanessa went yesterday to France for some days (her Gemini nieces are having their birthday next Sunday), so i used her lineage 2 account to create this cute little dwarf:

Damn that server is full, even in the starting villages lots of people are running around. Â I want to see a siege! Can't wait till i can start my own account and create my treasure hunter / adventurer. And i can't wait to see my old buddy Baium and his Tower of Insolence.

I must say the lineage 2 world appeals more to me than the World of Warcraft. Even the map:
