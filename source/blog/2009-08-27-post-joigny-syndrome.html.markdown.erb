Got back from Joigny france 2 days ago. We were 'cuz Vanessa's brother got married there last week. Â Pictures will be added later, when i find my camera back :D.

Strangely no cold turkey effects from having no internet this time. The stuff there kept us busy apperently! Didn't even play Lineage 2 since i got back.

Ah well, i'll post some pics from before we went:

[![Down in the catacombs](/images/lineage2_teon_catacombs_all_the_way_thumb.png)](/images/lineage2_teon_catacombs_all_the_way.jpg)

[![Sleeping on the job](/images/lineage2_teon_sleeping_on_the_job_thumb.png)](/images/lineage2_teon_sleeping_on_the_job.jpg)

I hope more will come!
