After the enormously boring quests Trial of the Seeker (for rogues), Testimony of Trust(for humans) and Test of the Searcher (for treasure hunters), finally dinged lvl 40 and became treasure hunter. Â After the class change i was kicked out of the clan academy (automatic system) and after that invited back into the main clan with a gift of 8kk. Bought full c-grade gear.

Can't wait till i can start the lvl 45 quest "An obvious lie", one of my favs. WTB Raccoon Ears.
