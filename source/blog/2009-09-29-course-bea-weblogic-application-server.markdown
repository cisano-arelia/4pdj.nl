Atm i'm sitting in the cantine of Oracle waiting for the 2nd day Weblogic AS course. Couple of weeks ago, Â i was accepted into the Oracle Fusion MiddleWare masterclass (general Oracle name for anything concerning service-oriented architecture). The Weblogic AS course is the first part of this track. The masterclass is intense for the next 2 months with after that 2 evenings per month for the next years.

Happy to learn something new!!!
