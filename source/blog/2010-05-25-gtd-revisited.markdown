My [GTD moleskine hack](/2010/04/27/gtd/) did great. Against all expectations of collegues and my soon to be wife, i kept up with GTD and the moleskine GTD implementation.

Time for a new GTD notebook and a review!

The simplicity and portability of the GTD moleskine is great. I love the smell of it, it has great quality paper, though there are 3 things that needed improvement:



	
  * flexibility
Starting a new notebook you have no idea how the eventual page distribution of your GTD notebook will be like.
The static page arrangement does not support the use of multiple separated contexts.  Real hacking starts when u start using pages backwards.

	
  * section separation
I used hard tabs and soft tabs from Post-it and others. They curl, break, block your writing or affect the portability of your moleskine.

	
  * pen
To carry a pen with the moleskine i used tape, rubber band, paper clips and looked at expensive leather covers and beautiful pen clips.


The flexibility issue had the most impact. So I started looking for other paper GTD systems. I still had 2 leather covers from [Succes](http://succes.com) Agenda's (sort of Filofax) in the sizes Junior and Mini bought around 1999 and 2004.  Had enough paper for a start and bought only some synthetic tabs.

The result:

[![GTD in Succes agenda](/images/gtd_succes_agenda_thumb-300x225.png)](/images/gtd_succes_agenda.jpg)

The tabs are arranged as followed:



	
  * Next actions context Work

	
  * Next actions context Home

	
  * Next actions context Errands

	
  * Waiting for

	
  * Projects

	
  * Someday/maybe


I use 5x3 cards as inbox. In the left pocket u see a "[hipster pda](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda)"-like stash of them.

Behind the GTD section i have a contact section with alfabet tabs.
