Finally the promised pictures! Not much, 'cuz i won't post people's pictures without their permission.

As mentioned before Vanessa's brother got married on the 22nd of august. It was in Joigny, in the Bourgogne:

Vanessa's mother and sister were staying at our house in the 3 weeks before we left, so we travelled together to Joigny. We went there with train:
	
  * Groningen 9:04 to Schiphol with the Intercity

	
  * Schiphol 12:49 to Paris Gare du Nord with the Thalys

	
  * Paris Gare du Nord 17:15 to Paris Gare du Lyon with a Taxi. Fast and cheap! 15 euro for 4 persons not bad

	
  * Paris Gare du Lyon 18:00 to Joigny


Our hotel:

Nice hotel, with swimming pool and sauna and good restaurant with traditional french cuisine. Mjam!

It was nice to see a french wedding, it's definitely different than in the Netherlands!
