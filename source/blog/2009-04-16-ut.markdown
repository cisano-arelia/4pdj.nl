Yesterday booted up Unreal Tournament 2004. Didn't play it for a long time.  Tested Unreal 3 some months ago, but it has no charms.  But anyway, i found a lot of my old clannies still playing. Even the clanbase cups are still running. Played some TAM / CTF. Still have some skills after 4 years, did quite alright. Got invited in a clan right  away. Probably as mascotte, but who knows.
