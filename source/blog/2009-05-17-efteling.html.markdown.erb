Today Vanessa and me took the train to Kaatsheuvel to the Efteling. A good 4 hours it took to get there, but of course worth it.

Wanting to start with an easy attraction, we went into Vogelrok. It turned out to be an high speed indoor roller coaster with no lights and sharp turns. The legs were shaky when i went out.

It's such a beautiful park with stuff for every age. We enjoyed ourselves so much.

Of course we did the standard stuff like Droomvlucht, Fata Morgana, Bobbaan and Piraña. We couldn't stop laughing in the Piraña, trying to turn each other into the waterfalls. It's an old attraction, looks boring from the outside, but sooo much fun.

Then we went into the Vliegende Hollander (still proud that Pirates of the Caribbean stole our story and turned it into Davy Jones Locker). The lines were long, but nice ambiance. We went down and down and down. But like always in the efteling, even when ur waiting, enough to see around u. At the bottom were 2 boats waiting for its passengers. Went aboard, noticed the amount of water on the inside of the boat, and Vanessa and me closed our coats. First in almost complete darkness we were pulled up a ramp. And then it let go of the boat and we went down in a light mist of water, only to see it was fake and we were pulled onto a bigger ramp. The doors opened and we went into a nice not to scary outside roller coaster and finally splashed into the water.  Not a drop landed on us. At the exit we looked at the photo. Vanessa immediately bought 2 copies of it. It shows people behind us chatting with each other, Vanessa having so much fun, and me looking like a stressed hamster. I'm sure it'll be shown at many birthdays! :D Too bad I promised her to scan the photo and place it here:

We came there at 11h, we were kicked out at 18h. A day well spent!!!

PS. On Utrecht Centraal we had Chinese at the Wok to Go. It was too much, we took 80% with us back to home and ate it the next day as dinner. Tasty!
