My company laptop with Windows is secured with McAfee Endpoint Encryption, formerly known as SafeBoot.
SafeBoot uses a custom MBR. 

I want to DualBoot Windows/Linux and boot Windows by chainloading the SafeBoot MBR from Grub2, so SafeBoot still works.
But:

* I do not wish to boot from USB / CD for Linux
* Altering the windows bootloader with EasyBCD is out of scope, as it costs money in a company environment.

/dev/sda1-2-3 are claimed by Windows.

I succeeded partly implementing above wishes. I did the following:

* backup MBR with from Ubuntu Live with:

    dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/mbr-backup bs=512 count=1

* shrink windows volume
* install ubuntu on new partition /dev/sda4 with some lvm volumes and with grub setup on /dev/sda1.
* add the following menu entry to grub2:

~~~~~~~~
    menuentry "Windows 7" {
       insmod lvm
       chainloader (lvm/ubuntu-root)/safeboot.mbr
    }
~~~~~~~~

Loading the MBR image gives the following problems:

* Windows 7 or SafeBoot overwrites the /dev/sda partition table with partition table in safeboot.mbr
* Windows 7 or SafeBoot overwrites the data of core.img which is located behind the MBR.

The first point can be 'fixed' by updating the partition table in the MBR backup.

Now I'm stuck with the second problem.
