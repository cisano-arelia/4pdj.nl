Was a busy week! I had two courses of the Fusion MiddleWare masterclass again. Monday + Tuesday Oracle BPEL and Wednesday Oracle Enterprise Service Bus (now Mediator).

Came thursday morning at work, thinking of having a relaxing morning with a bit of acclimatizing. But no, could go straight to work again :). Happy tho to have something to do.

Friday evening i was tired and a bit bored so i bought myself a month of World of Warcraft playtime. After 1 hour of installation and 2 hours of updating, i was playing with my old character again. But with a twist, i've given my druid a sex change and a new name :):
