Today Vanessa and me went to my parents who were standing on a farm camping in Zwaagwesteinde  (Fryslan). Took the bikes with us, 'cuz the area there  is nice biking material. Very beautiful. A little picture of the dinner afterwards, made with my HTC Diamond which automatically makes it softfocus????? WTF.

At home, we showered directly, we're totally burned from the sun. Vanessa is playing Lineage. Her soon to be bishop is lvl 9 :D
