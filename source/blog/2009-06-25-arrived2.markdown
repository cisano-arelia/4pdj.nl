It finally arrived, and complete! Amazon did his thing!

Registered the game, entered the credit card blabla, and started playing.

Playing with the rogue (will be treasure hunter at lvl 40) is lots of fun. Vanessa was waiting with her cleric (soon to be bishop) Â at lvl 20 for me. Playing together now in the Gludio area.
